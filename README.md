# Numbat-Cons_TidyTuesday_2023_3_27

1. Introduction
This analysis is part of the weekly data analysis program from Tidy Tuesday. It consists of a community of individuals that have a passion for data analytics. Each week, the community analyzes a data project, shares their findings to enhance data analysis skills, and deepen understanding of the week’s subject. The goal of this projects focus is the numbat, an endangered animal native to Australia. This data analysis project is to analyzed the numbat’s population in Australia to aid in the conservation of its declining species.


2. The numbat data that we are analyzing will answer the following questions:

    ● Where do you find numbats in Australia?

    ● Was the distribution more widespread historically? (You may need to exclude zoo reported observations.)

    ● What time of day do numbat sightings occur?

    ● Are they more frequent in the summer or winter?

    ● Are numbats seen more on sunny and warm days than cloudy, wet, cold days?

    ● Do sightings happen more on week days than weekends?

By answering these questions, we can further understand the numbat population and improve conservation of these unique animals.

3. Preparing for Data Exploration
     The raw data for this analysis is found in the website Atlas of Living Australia. However since this project is based from Tidy Tuesday, they have prepared the data for analysis to meet the specific goals in the tidytuesday project. You can find this altered data in the Github tidytuesday link here.

4. Process Data from Raw Data to Clean
    This analysis project will be conducted using R programming due to its free, open-source, statistical and graphical analysis capabilities. Please note to refer to the Appendix regarding the R programming.
